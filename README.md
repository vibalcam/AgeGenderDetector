## Data

[UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)

[UTKFace dataset Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new)

This dataset contains over 20,000 face images with annotations of
age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, 
illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.

### Data Explanation

If a photo is called __34_0_0_201701171712010149082.jpg.chip.jpg__, it means that the age of the individual is 34 and his gender is male. 
That is, the photo names follow the following scheme __age_gender_race_relevant_data.jpg.chip.jpg__.

Gender being 0 for male and 1 for female.


## Model Full

We have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the age and gender of the **full** input image.

We have obtained the following metrics:
- Validation:
  - Gender accuracy: 0.869
  - Age MSE: 135.65
  - Age MAE: 8.54
- Test:
  - Gender accuracy: 0.878
  - Age MSE: 140.35
  - Age MAE: 8.68


## Model Cropped

We have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the age and gender of the **cropped** input image.

We have obtained the following metrics:
- Validation:
  - Gender accuracy: 0.905
  - Age MSE: 78.956
- Test:
  - Gender accuracy: 0.915
  - Age MSE: 75.28

## Steps to run web app

From the main project folder (AgeGenderDetector/) run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, from one of the main folders (AgeGenderDetector/full/ or AgeGenderDetector/cropped/) run the following command:

```shell
python -m dashboard.dashboard
```
